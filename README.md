# Development of a Virtual Reality Container Crane Simulation

The aim of this project is to develop a virtual reality (VR) simulation for operator
training of container cranes which are remotely controlled, situated at the cargo ports. The
simulation consists of a virtual control room equipped with joysticks and display screens,
container crane, container ships, trucks and a cargo port environment. We used an actual
super post-Panamax quay crane as a reference model for this simulation. The project has been
built using Unity3d for the programming and 3DSMAX for the designing of models. The
virtual joysticks in the simulation can be interacted by using the Oculus Rift VR setup thus
allowing to maneuver the crane and the container load in all three dimensions.
